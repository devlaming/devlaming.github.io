In your e-mail, make sure to include your first name, family name, and student number.\n\nImportant practicalities\nBefore starting with the course, please pay careful attention to the following practicalities regarding studying at the VU and regarding this particular course.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSigning up for course activities\n\n\n\nFor questions related to signing up (Dutch: intekenen) for instruction lectures, computer tutorials, exams, and resits: please contact our Student Desk.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonal circumstances\n\n\n\nTo discuss personal circumstances that interfere with your studies, please contact our Academic Advisors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegister in time for exams and resits\n\n\n\nAs a student you are obliged to sign up yourself for courses, instruction lecture groups, computer tutorial groups, exams, as well as resit exams. The are strict deadlines for signing up. In case you do not sign up for exams or resits in time, your result will not be valid.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou must pass QRM1 in your first year\n\n\n\nQRM1 is part of the Binding recommendation on continuation of studies (Dutch: Bindend Studieadvies; BSA). This means that if you do not pass the course in your first year, you cannot continue your studies. Please be aware!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo resit for the computed-based partial exams\n\n\n\nNo resit is offered for the two partial exams (in Week 3 and Week 6 respectively). Only for the written exam in Week 8 is a resit offered (one resit in December and another resit in the second semester).\n\n\n\n\nCourse at a glance\nThe bachelor Economics and Business Economics (EBE) comprises three core academic courses, namely, Quantitative Research Methods (QRM) 1, QRM2, and QRM3, which are taught in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd year respectively. In these courses, you develop mathematical and statistical skills that you need to answer questions in economics and business in a meaningfull, quantitative manner.\nWhile QRM2 and QRM3 pay much attention to statistics, econometrics, and their applications, QRM1 is a more fundamental course, in which you learn about core concepts from mathematics, linear algebra, and calculus. Thus, QRM2 and QRM3, as well as many other courses in the EBE bachelor, build on the knowledge you acquire in this course.\n\n\n\n\nCopyrightRonald de Vlaming. 2024. All Rights Reserved"

    "text": "This week, we start with a careful treatment of mathematical concepts you have learnt about in high school. Specifically, we begin the by discussing numbers. What are integers, real numbers, and so on? And what are variables in mathematics, and why are they useful? With those concepts in place, we can talk about algebra: expressions involving numbers, variables, and operators, such as addition and multiplication, and exponentiation. How to evaluate and simplify such expression?\nNext, we can look at equalities and inequalities: if two expressions are equal, then what can we learn about the underlying variables? Specifically, we consider solving linear and quadratic equations. And what if one expression is know to be larger than the other? What can we learn, in that case, about certain variables?\nAfter that, we turn our attention to functions: why are they useful? what is the right notation? And what are things like the domain and image of a function? With those concepts in place, we can look at finding roots of a function, which actually boils down to simply solving equations.\nFinally, we go a little bit into set theory and indices, and use that to formulate so-called aggregation operators, such as the summation and product operator."

To make matters worse, some things are rather hard to count in a discrete fashion (e.g., the time from sunrise until sunset).\nYet, despite the fact that whole numbers can be thought of as counts of idealised, discrete units, its practical merits are undeniable.

After all, you cannot have a negative number of apples. Thus, equations (more on that later) with negative solutions (e.g., \\(4x + 20 = 4 \\Leftrightarrow x=-4\\)) were considered to be absurb by Greek mathematicians. Even as late as the 16th century, negative numbers were, in academic work, sometimes still referred to as absurd numbers.\nHowever, even for simple accounting purposes, such as a decrease in your stock of apples, a debt to a counterparty, and so on, the uses of negative numbers became ever more apparant. Nowadays, negative numbers are recognised as an integral part of everyday calculations.\nThere are seven important things to remember about negative numbers:\n\nWe denote negative numbers by placing the minus sign (\\(-\\)) in front of the number. So \\(-4\\) denotes negative four. Positive numbers, on the other hand, are either denoted by placing the plus sign (\\(+\\)) in front of it or by not writing down the sign altogether (more common, just like in spoken language; e.g., we typically do not ask for plus four slices of bread). So both \\(4\\) and \\(+4\\) denote positive four, where \\(4\\) is the more common notation.\nAdding up negative \\(x\\) and positive \\(x\\), where \\(x\\) is a number, yields zero: they are opposite numbers that cancel when added up. So \\(-x+x=0\\).\nThe more negative a number is, the lower it is. So, for example, \\(-5 &lt; -4\\), while on the positive side, \\(5 &gt; 4\\). In words, we say \\(-5\\) is less than \\(-4\\), while \\(5\\) is greater than \\(4\\).\nThe negative of a negative number is a positive number. That is, \\(-(-x)=x\\).\nA negative number \\(-x\\) times another negative number \\(-y\\) yields a positive number, which is equal to multiplying \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). So \\(-4\\) times \\(-3\\) yields the same result as \\(4\\) times \\(3\\), which is \\(12\\).\nA negative number \\(-x\\) times a positive number \\(y\\) yields a negative result, which is equal to the negative of multiplying \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). So \\(-4\\) times \\(3\\) equals the negative of \\(4\\) times \\(3\\), so \\(-12\\).\nA negative number \\(-x\\) can also be thought of as \\(x\\) multiplied by \\(-1\\). So simply using (i) all positive numbers, (ii) multiplication, and (iii) only a single negative number, namely \\(-1\\), we have a way to describe all negative numbers that exist.\n\n\n\nInfinity\nThe introduction of negative numbers is what we call an abstraction: we started with something clearly rooted in our understanding of reality at the time (i.e., counts), and we made the concept a bit more general (i.e., negative numbers), to help us solve more problems, that are still relevant in everyday life (e.g., keeping track of someone’s debt).\nTwo further abstractions that arose as mathematics matured were the number zero (which effectively says there is nothing to count) and the number infinity, denoted by \\(\\infty\\). Clearly, in our everyday lives infinity does not exist: we live in finite world, with finite resources, finite energy, and so on.\nYet, zero and infinity are extremely useful to calculate certain things: they are an crucial part of calculus (i.e., differentiation and integration), which is all about finding optimal points (e.g., how much crop to grow to maximise profit?), areas and volumes (e.g., what is the volume of a ball with radius \\(r\\)?), as well as certain expectations (e.g., what is my expected profit, under all kinds of circumstances, that happen with different probabilities?).\nJust like any number \\(x\\) has a negative counterpart \\(-x\\), so does \\(\\infty\\) have negative counterpart \\(-\\infty\\).\nThe complete set of all whole numbers, so both negative and positive, ranging from \\(-\\infty\\) to \\(\\infty\\), are called the integers. This set of numbers is sometimes denoted by \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\). That is, \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\) consists of \\(\\ldots,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,\\ldots\\), where the dots signify that numbers just keep on going on, all the way down to \\(-\\infty\\) on the left and all the way up to \\(\\infty\\) on the right."

If you have a single apple to share equally with a friend, you both have half an apple. That is, you both have \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\), where the upper term (here \\(1\\)) is called the numerator (Dutch: teller) and the lower term (here \\(2\\)) the denominator (Dutch: noemer).\nMore generally, rational numbers are written in the form \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\) where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both integers (so including negative numbers). When considering counts (so \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) both being natural numbers), \\(a\\) tells us how many units of one thing we have (e.g., the number of apples \\(a\\)) and \\(b\\) tells us across how many other units to divide this (e.g., the number of people \\(b\\) who get to share those \\(a\\) apples).\nThe complete set of all rational numbers, so \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\), for any integer \\(a\\) and any integer \\(b\\), is denoted by \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\)."

    "text": "Irrational numbers and real numbers\nIn the past, it was thought \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) contained all numbers in existence, even numbers such as \\(\\pi \\approx 3.14\\), which is defined as the ratio of the circumference (Dutch: omtrek) of a perfect circle, divided by twice its radius. However, this turns out to be wrong: \\(\\pi\\) cannot be expressed as the ratio of two whole numbers. And \\(\\pi\\) is no exception—there exist infinitely many numbers that cannot be expressed as the ratio of two integers. Such numbers are said to be irrational.\nFor example, take a square with sides of length one, and calculate the length of a line that you draw from one corner of the square to the corner on the opposite side, called the hypotenuse (Dutch: schuine zijde). That is, you split the square into two identical right triangles (Dutch: rechthoekige driehoek):\n\n\n\nHypotenuse with irrational length\n\n\nThat length, by Pythagoras’ Theorem, equals \\(\\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2}=\\sqrt{2}\\), which is a number that also cannot be described as the ratio of two whole numbers. Nevertheless, the Pythagorean community in the ancient Greece considered the whole idea of irrational numbers to be heresy. They refused to accept that \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) was irrational, and attempted to suppress proofs of this claim:\n\nHowever, proof for the existence of irrational numbers is undeniable. And, as discussed, they arise naturally in geometry as well as calculus, for instance, when we consider a number \\(e\\), such that the rate of change of \\(e^x\\) with respect to \\(x\\), also equals \\(e^x\\) (Euler’s number).\nCombining the irrational and rational numbers into a grand set of numbers, we arrive at the set of so-called real numbers, which is denoted by \\(\\mathbb{R}\\). This set contains any number on the number line from \\(-\\infty\\) to \\(\\infty\\), regardless of whether irrational or rational. The whole numbers are in fact the working horse of much of modern mathematics, including calculus.\nHave a look at the YouTube video below, for a short proof of why \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) is indeed irrational. When watching it, pay close attention to the mathematical tools employed there (such as proof by contradiction). Pretty neat, isn’t it?"

    "text": "Mathematics as a world of ideas\nMuch of mathematics considers idealised objects and their properties (e.g., the perfect circle, with radius \\(r\\), for which the area is given by \\(A=\\pi r^2\\)). These idealised objects often do not exist in the real world. Yet, both the origins as well as the applications of many notions in mathematics, in the end, lie in the real world. But how can an idealised concept be relevant in the real world, given that the real world is never perfect?\nThe reason for this is quite simple: many everyday phenomena and objects can be approximated really well by idealised objects, of which we know the properties."

    "text": "Variables and expressions\nClearly, at this point, we have already touched upon so-called variables: quantities that are free or unknown. For instance, \\(x\\) could denote the number of units sold at a price of five euros per unit. Thus, revenue (Dutch: omzet) is then given by \\(5x\\). Here, \\(5x\\) is an expression and \\(x\\) a variable.\nAs is the case in this example, the expressions you start with in certain analytical questions typically reflect something that has real-world meaning. In the example, the real-world meaning of \\(5x\\) is that it reflects revenue.\nIn case the production costs of \\(x\\) units are \\(3\\) euro per unit, then clearly \\(3x\\) reflects total costs. This is another expression with a clear real-world meaning. Moreover, defining profit as revenue minus costs, \\(5x - 3x\\) tells us what the profit is if \\(x\\) units are produced and sold. This is yet another expression with real-world meaning. Notice that \\(5x - 3x\\) is actually equal to \\(2x\\). In other words, by manipulating our expression for profit, we can find a simpler expression which states that profit is given by \\(2x\\).\nThe main reason why you learn about algebra is to be able to simplify expressions in such a way. But why are we interested in simplified expressions? The exact purpose of that will become apparent later on. For now, it suffices to say that, in many situations in business and economics, we want to figure out, for instance, the optimal level of production, advertisement spending, and so on. And simple expressions are often much easier to solve than ones that unnecessarily complicated."

    "text": "Multiple variables\nTo illustrate the direction in which QRM1 will be going, let us now consider a slight generalisation of the previous example. Instead of selling at a known price of five euros per unit, let us also treat the selling price per unit as a free variable denoted by \\(p\\). Then, total revenue is given by \\(p \\times x\\) (often also denoted by \\(p \\cdot x\\), or even more briefly \\(px\\)). This expression has two variable: price \\(p\\) and units sold \\(x\\).\nNow consider a company selling three types of products: \\(X\\), \\(Y\\), and \\(Z\\), where \\(x\\) denotes the number of units of \\(X\\) that is sold, \\(y\\) the number of units of \\(Y\\), and so on. Similarly, let \\(p_X\\) denote the price per unit at which Product \\(X\\) is sold, \\(p_Y\\) the price per unit of \\(Y\\), and so on.\nHence, the revenue from Product \\(X\\), \\(Y\\), and \\(Z\\) is given by \\(p_X x\\), \\(p_Y y\\), and \\(p_Z z\\) respectively. As a result, total revenue is given by the following expression:\n\\[\np_X x + p_Y y + p_Z z.\n\\]\nThis is an expression involving six variables. That may seem quite impressive. But if we evaluate that expression for specific quantities and prices, all it boils down are three distinct multiplications, and then adding up the resulting three terms. For instance, if \\(p_X = 5\\), \\(p_Y=4\\), and \\(p_Z=3\\), while \\(x=3\\), \\(y=4\\), and \\(z=2\\), then revenue is given by\n\\[\n5 \\cdot 3 + 4 \\cdot 4 + 3 \\cdot 2 = 15 + 16 + 6 = 37.\n\\]\nAt the end of this week’s reader, we will introduce the summation operator to write this type of expression more compactly. Such notation is, for instance, particularly useful in case one sells considerably more than just three distinct products."

Knowing how to apply these operators to reasonably large numbers by hand gives you a firm understanding of arithmetic, and thereby paves the way for a solid understanding of algebra. We encourage you to watch the videos in this section, and to work on the exercises.\n\nAddition\nHere is a nice little video of how to add two or more numbers with multiple digits:\n\nNow consider the following exercises:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 1\n\n\n\nUsing the approach explained in the preceding video,\n\ncalculate \\(16 + 3\\)\ncalculate \\(28 + 4\\)\ncalculate \\(91 + 9\\)\ncalculate \\(667 + 3\\)\ncalculate \\(995 + 6\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2\n\n\n\nUsing the same approach,\n\ncalculate \\(16 + 23\\)\ncalculate \\(27 + 38\\)\ncalculate \\(48 + 71\\)\ncalculate \\(63 + 48\\)\ncalculate \\(667 + 333\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 3\n\n\n\nUsing the same approach,\n\nadd five questions about adding three numbers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolutions Exercises 1–3\n\n\n\n\n\nUse a calculator to check if your solutions are correct 😉\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 4\n\n\n\nUsing the same type of approach, but now considering a binary system, in which the lowest and highest digit are \\(0\\) and \\(1\\) respectively,\n\nadd \\(1\\) and \\(1\\)\nadd \\(10\\) and \\(1\\)\nadd \\(11\\) and \\(1\\)\nadd \\(10\\) and \\(10\\)\nadd \\(11\\) and \\(11\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolutions Exercises 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince \\(1+1\\) would excheed highest permitted digit (i.e., \\(2\\) cannot happen under a binary system), we need to carry \\(1\\) the next digit. And since the original terms both do not contribute directly to the second digit, we get \\(1+1=10\\).\n\\(10+1=11\\)\nFor \\(11+1\\), when we add the first (i.e., right-most) digit of both numbers, we again exceed the highest premitted digit. So we can carry \\(1\\) to the second digit. When that carried over digit is added to the second digit of \\(11\\), we again exceed the highest permitted digit, so we carry \\(1\\) to the third digit, thus, yielding \\(11+1=100\\).\nSimilar logic: \\(10+10=100\\)\nFor \\(11+11\\) adding the first digit of both numbers yields a \\(0\\) and a \\(1\\) that’s carried over to the next digit. There, adding up the 2nd digit of both terms and the carry-over \\(1\\), we would get \\(3\\) under a decimal system; but this is a binary system… So we hit another carry-over \\(1\\), which will go to the third digit, and the second digit itself being \\(1\\). Thus, we get \\(11+11=110\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 5\n\n\n\nUsing Table 1, convert all binary numbers in the previous to decimal numbers, add up those decimal numbers, and then convert the resulting numbers to binary numbers again using Table 1. Compare the result to answers you obtained in Exercise 4. What do you conclude?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolutions Exercises 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecimal representation: \\(1+1=2\\), where the result has binary representation \\(10\\)\nDecimal representation: \\(2+1=3\\), where the result has binary representation \\(11\\)\nDecimal representation: \\(3+1=4\\), where the result has binary representation \\(100\\)\nDecimal representation: \\(2+2=4\\), where the result has binary representation \\(100\\)\nDecimal representation: \\(3+3=6\\), where the result has binary representation \\(110\\)\n\nConclusion: the addition of the numbers under a binary of decimal system yields completely equivalent results!
