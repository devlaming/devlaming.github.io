What are integers, real numbers, and so on? And what are variables in mathematics, and why are they useful? With those concepts in place, we can talk about algebra: expressions involving numbers, variables, and operators, such as addition and multiplication, and exponentiation. How to evaluate and simplify such expression?\nNext, we can look at equalities and inequalities: if two expressions are equal, then what can we learn about the underlying variables? Specifically, we consider solving linear and quadratic equations. And what if one expression is know to be larger than the other? What can we learn, in that case, about certain variables?\nFinally, we consider set theory and indices, and use that to formulate so-called aggregation operators, such as the summation and product operator. Using these operators, we discuss descriptive statistics (such as sample mean and variance), while paying attention to how one should format these."

After all, you cannot have a negative number of apples. Thus, equations (more on that later) with negative solutions (e.g., \\(4x + 20 = 4 \\Leftrightarrow x=-4\\)) were considered to be absurb by Greek mathematicians. Even as late as the 16th century, negative numbers were, in academic work, sometimes still referred to as absurd numbers.\nHowever, even for simple accounting purposes, such as a decrease in your stock of apples, a debt to a counterparty, and so on, the uses of negative numbers became ever more apparant. Nowadays, negative numbers are recognised as an integral part of everyday calculations.\nThere are seven important things to remember about negative numbers:\n\nWe denote negative numbers by placing the minus sign (\\(-\\)) in front of the number. So \\(-4\\) denotes negative four. Positive numbers, on the other hand, are either denoted by placing the plus sign (\\(+\\)) in front of it or by not writing down the sign altogether (more common, just like in spoken language; e.g., we typically do not ask for plus four slices of bread). So both \\(4\\) and \\(+4\\) denote positive four, where \\(4\\) is the more common notation.\nAdding up negative \\(x\\) and positive \\(x\\), where \\(x\\) is a number, yields zero: they are opposite numbers that cancel when added up. So \\(-x+x=0\\).\nThe more negative a number is, the lower it is. So, for example, \\(-5 &lt; -4\\), while on the positive side, \\(5 &gt; 4\\). In words, we say \\(-5\\) is less than \\(-4\\), while \\(5\\) is greater than \\(4\\).\nThe negative of a negative number is a positive number. That is, \\(-(-x)=x\\).\nA negative number \\(-x\\) times another negative number \\(-y\\) yields a positive number, which is equal to multiplying \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). So \\(-4\\) times \\(-3\\) yields the same result as \\(4\\) times \\(3\\), which is \\(12\\).\nA negative number \\(-x\\) times a positive number \\(y\\) yields a negative result, which is equal to the negative of multiplying \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). So \\(-4\\) times \\(3\\) equals the negative of \\(4\\) times \\(3\\), so \\(-12\\).\nA negative number \\(-x\\) can also be thought of as \\(x\\) multiplied by \\(-1\\). So simply using (i) all positive numbers, (ii) multiplication, and (iii) only a single negative number, namely \\(-1\\), we have a way to describe all negative numbers that exist.\n\n\n\nInfinity\nThe introduction of negative numbers is what we call an abstraction: we started with something clearly rooted in our understanding of reality at the time (i.e., counts), and we made the concept a bit more general (i.e., negative numbers), to help us solve more problems, that are still relevant in everyday life (e.g., keeping track of someone’s debt).\nTwo further abstractions that arose as mathematics matured were the number zero (which effectively says there is nothing to count) and an infinitely large number, denoted by \\(\\infty\\), simply called infinity. Clearly, in our everyday lives infinity does not exist: we live in finite world, with finite resources, finite energy, and so on.\nYet, zero and infinity are extremely useful to calculate certain things: they are an crucial part of calculus (i.e., differentiation and integration), which is all about finding optimal points (e.g., how much crop to grow to maximise profit?), areas and volumes (e.g., what is the volume of a ball with radius \\(r\\)?), as well as certain expectations (e.g., what is my expected profit, under all kinds of circumstances, that happen with different probabilities?).\nJust like any number \\(x\\) has a negative counterpart \\(-x\\), so does \\(\\infty\\) have negative counterpart \\(-\\infty\\).\nThe complete set of all whole numbers, so both negative and positive, ranging from \\(-\\infty\\) to \\(\\infty\\), are called the integers. This set of numbers is sometimes denoted by \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\). That is, \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\) consists of \\(\\ldots,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,\\ldots\\), where the dots signify that numbers just keep on going on, all the way down to \\(-\\infty\\) on the left and all the way up to \\(\\infty\\) on the right."

That is, you both have \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\), where the upper term (here \\(1\\)) is called the numerator (Dutch: teller) and the lower term (here \\(2\\)) the denominator (Dutch: noemer).\nMore generally, rational numbers are written in the form \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\) where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both integers (so including negative numbers). When considering counts (so \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) both being natural numbers), \\(a\\) tells us how many units of one thing we have (e.g., the number of apples \\(a\\)) and \\(b\\) tells us across how many other units to divide this (e.g., the number of people \\(b\\) who get to share those \\(a\\) apples).\nThe complete set of all rational numbers, so \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\), for any integer \\(a\\) and any integer \\(b\\), is denoted by \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\)."

    "text": "Irrational numbers and real numbers\nIn the past, it was thought \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) contained all numbers in existence, even numbers such as \\(\\pi \\approx 3.14\\), which is defined as the ratio of the circumference (Dutch: omtrek) of a perfect circle, divided by twice its radius. However, this turns out to be wrong: \\(\\pi\\) cannot be expressed as the ratio of two whole numbers. And \\(\\pi\\) is no exception—there exist infinitely many numbers that cannot be expressed as the ratio of two integers. Such numbers are said to be irrational.\nFor example, take a square with sides of length one, and calculate the length of a line that you draw from one corner of the square to the corner on the opposite side, called the hypotenuse (Dutch: schuine zijde). That is, you split the square into two identical right triangles (Dutch: rechthoekige driehoek):\n\n\n\nHypotenuse with irrational length\n\n\nThat length, by Pythagoras’ Theorem, equals \\(\\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2}=\\sqrt{2}\\), which is a number that also cannot be described as the ratio of two whole numbers. Nevertheless, the Pythagorean community in the ancient Greece considered the whole idea of irrational numbers to be heresy. They refused to accept that \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) was irrational, and attempted to suppress proofs of this claim:\n\nHowever, proof for the existence of irrational numbers is undeniable. And, as discussed, they arise naturally in geometry as well as calculus, for instance, when we consider a number \\(e\\), such that the rate of change of \\(e^x\\) with respect to \\(x\\), also equals \\(e^x\\) (Euler’s number).\nCombining the irrational and rational numbers into a grand set of numbers, we arrive at the set of so-called real numbers, which is denoted by \\(\\mathbb{R}\\). This set contains any number on the number line from \\(-\\infty\\) to \\(\\infty\\), regardless of whether irrational or rational. The whole numbers are in fact the working horse of much of modern mathematics, including calculus.\nHave a look at the YouTube video below, for a short proof of why \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) is indeed irrational. When watching it, pay close attention to the mathematical tools employed there (such as proof by contradiction). Pretty neat, isn’t it?"

    "text": "Variables and expressions\nIn the preceding part we already relied on the concept of a variable: a quantity that is free or unknown. For instance, \\(x\\) could denote the number of units sold at a price of five euros per unit. Thus, revenue (Dutch: omzet) is then given by \\(5x\\). Here, \\(5x\\) is an expression and \\(x\\) a variable.\nAs is the case in this example, the expressions you start with in certain analytical questions typically reflect something that has real-world meaning. In the example, the real-world meaning of \\(5x\\) is that it reflects revenue.\nIn case the production costs of \\(x\\) units are \\(3\\) euro per unit, then clearly \\(3x\\) reflects total costs. This is another expression with a clear real-world meaning. Moreover, defining profit as revenue minus costs, \\(5x - 3x\\) tells us what the profit is if \\(x\\) units are produced and sold. This is yet another expression with real-world meaning. Notice that \\(5x - 3x\\) is actually equal to \\(2x\\). In other words, by manipulating our expression for profit, we can find a simpler expression which states that profit is given by \\(2x\\).\nThe main reason why you learn about algebra is to be able to simplify expressions in such a way. But why are we interested in simplified expressions? The exact purpose of that will become apparent later on. For now, it suffices to say that, in many situations in business and economics, we want to figure out, for instance, the optimal level of production, advertisement spending, and so on. And simple expressions are often much easier to solve than ones that unnecessarily complicated."

    "text": "Multiple variables\nTo illustrate the direction in which QRM1 will be going, let us now consider a slight generalisation of the previous example. Instead of selling at a known price of five euros per unit, let us also treat the selling price per unit as a free variable denoted by \\(p\\). Then, total revenue is given by \\(p \\times x\\) (often also denoted by \\(p \\cdot x\\), or even more briefly \\(px\\)). This expression has two variable: price \\(p\\) and units sold \\(x\\).\nNow consider a company selling three types of products: \\(X\\), \\(Y\\), and \\(Z\\), where \\(x\\) denotes the number of units of \\(X\\) that is sold, \\(y\\) the number of units of \\(Y\\), and so on. Similarly, let \\(p_X\\) denote the price per unit at which Product \\(X\\) is sold, \\(p_Y\\) the price per unit of \\(Y\\), and so on.\nHence, the revenue from Product \\(X\\), \\(Y\\), and \\(Z\\) is given by \\(p_X x\\), \\(p_Y y\\), and \\(p_Z z\\) respectively. As a result, total revenue is given by the following expression:\n\\[\np_X x + p_Y y + p_Z z.\n\\]\nThis is an expression involving six variables. That may seem quite impressive. But if we evaluate that expression for specific quantities and prices, all it boils down are three distinct multiplications, and then adding up the resulting three terms. For instance, if \\(p_X = 5\\), \\(p_Y=4\\), and \\(p_Z=3\\), while \\(x=3\\), \\(y=4\\), and \\(z=2\\), then revenue is given by\n\\[\n5 \\cdot 3 + 4 \\cdot 4 + 3 \\cdot 2 = 15 + 16 + 6 = 37.\n\\]\nAt the end of this week’s reader, we will introduce the summation operator to write this type of expression more compactly. Such notation is, for instance, particularly useful in case one sells considerably more than just three distinct products."

Knowing how to apply these operators to reasonably large numbers by hand gives you a firm understanding of arithmetic, and thereby paves the way for a solid understanding of algebra. We encourage you to watch the videos in this section, and to work on the exercises.\n\nAddition\nAddition of two numbers or variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) is denoted by \\(a+b\\). In case you do not really recall how manual addition of two multidigit numbers works, here is a nice little video showing you how to do to this:\n\nNow consider the following exercises:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 1\n\n\n\nUsing the approach explained in the preceding video,\n\ncalculate \\(16 + 3\\)\ncalculate \\(28 + 4\\)\ncalculate \\(91 + 9\\)\ncalculate \\(667 + 3\\)\ncalculate \\(995 + 6\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2\n\n\n\nUsing the same approach,\n\ncalculate \\(16 + 23\\)\ncalculate \\(27 + 38\\)\ncalculate \\(48 + 71\\)\ncalculate \\(63 + 48\\)\ncalculate \\(667 + 333\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 3\n\n\n\nUsing the same approach,\n\ncalculate \\(92 + 63 + 16\\)\ncalculate \\(112 + 685 + 137\\)\ncalculate \\(667 + 233 + 100\\)\ncalculate \\(1000 + 100 + 10 + 1\\)\ncalculate \\(9999 + 999 + 99 + 9\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolutions Exercises 1–3\n\n\n\n\n\nUse a calculator to check if your solutions are correct 😉\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 4\n\n\n\nUsing the same type of approach, but now considering a binary system, in which the lowest and highest digit are \\(0\\) and \\(1\\) respectively,\n\nadd \\(1\\) and \\(1\\)\nadd \\(10\\) and \\(1\\)\nadd \\(11\\) and \\(1\\)\nadd \\(10\\) and \\(10\\)\nadd \\(11\\) and \\(11\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolutions Exercises 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince \\(1+1\\) would excheed highest permitted digit (i.e., \\(2\\) cannot happen under a binary system), we need to carry \\(1\\) the next digit. And since the original terms both do not contribute directly to the second digit, we get \\(1+1=10\\).\n\\(10+1=11\\)\nFor \\(11+1\\), when we add the first (i.e., right-most) digit of both numbers, we again exceed the highest premitted digit. So we can carry \\(1\\) to the second digit. When that carried over digit is added to the second digit of \\(11\\), we again exceed the highest permitted digit, so we carry \\(1\\) to the third digit, thus, yielding \\(11+1=100\\).\nSimilar logic: \\(10+10=100\\)\nFor \\(11+11\\) adding the first digit of both numbers yields a \\(0\\) and a \\(1\\) that’s carried over to the next digit. There, adding up the 2nd digit of both terms and the carry-over \\(1\\), we would get \\(3\\) under a decimal system; but this is a binary system… So we hit another carry-over \\(1\\), which will go to the third digit, and the second digit itself being \\(1\\). Thus, we get \\(11+11=110\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 5\n\n\n\nUsing Table 1, convert all binary numbers in the previous to decimal numbers, add up those decimal numbers, and then convert the resulting numbers to binary numbers again using Table 1. Compare the result to answers you obtained in Exercise 4. What do you conclude?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolutions Exercises 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecimal representation: \\(1+1=2\\), where the result has binary representation \\(10\\)\nDecimal representation: \\(2+1=3\\), where the result has binary representation \\(11\\)\nDecimal representation: \\(3+1=4\\), where the result has binary representation \\(100\\)\nDecimal representation: \\(2+2=4\\), where the result has binary representation \\(100\\)\nDecimal representation: \\(3+3=6\\), where the result has binary representation \\(110\\)\n\nConclusion: the addition of the numbers under a binary of decimal system yields completely equivalent results! The only thing that changes is how we represent numbers, but not their properties, such as how addition works.\n\n\n\nIn this way, you can easily calculate the result of the following addition yourself (which, for example, Excel cannot do with anywhere near enough precision):\n\n\n\n21,383,921,321,980,823,802,703\n\n\n13,923,920\n\n\n841\n\n\n+ ————————————————————————————————\n\n\n21,383,921,321,980,837,727,464\n\n\n\nAn important property of addition is that the order does not matter. That is, \\(a+b = b+a\\) for any numbers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\n\n\nSubtraction\nSubtraction of one number or variable \\(b\\) from another number or variable \\(a\\) is denoted by \\(a-b\\). For subtraction, order matters! Specifically, for most numbers \\(a - b \\neq b-a\\). For instance, \\(5-3\\) is certainly not the same as \\(3-5\\); the former equals \\(2\\), while the latter equals \\(-2\\). Only if \\(a=b\\), are \\(a-b\\) and \\(b-a\\) the same. After all, in those cases \\(a-b\\) can be written as \\(a-a=0\\), and, similarly, \\(b-a\\) can be written as \\(b-b=0\\). In that case, \\(a-b\\) and \\(b-a\\) both being equal to zero means \\(a-b = b-a\\).\nAnother important thing to know about this operator is that subtracting \\(b\\) can also be thought of as adding negative \\(b\\). That is, \\(a-b = a + (-b)\\), where \\(a-b\\) denotes \\(b\\) subtracted from \\(a\\), whereas \\(a+(-b)\\) denotes adding \\(-b\\) to \\(a\\). For example, \\(5-3\\) is the same as \\(5 + (-3)\\), which in turn is the same as \\((-3)+5\\).\nA conceptual tool that can help you understand how subtraction works, is by considering the line of real numbers, with lower numbers on the left and higher numbers on the right. Now, adding a positive number or subtracting a negative number can both be thought of as going in the right direction. For example: \\(1+2\\) and \\(1-(-2)\\) both can be thought of as starting at \\(1\\) and then taking two steps to the right, yielding \\(3\\), as shown in green in Figure 1. On the other hand, subtracting a positive number or adding a negative number can both be thought of as going in the left direction. For example: \\(1-2\\) and \\(1+(-2)\\) can be thought of as starting at \\(1\\) and then taking two steps to the left, yielding \\(-1\\), as shown in red in Figure 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Addition and subtraction on the number line\n\n\n\nSubtraction is not constrained to single-digit whole numbers, of course. Like with addition, when subtracting \\(a\\) from \\(b\\), \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) can be any real numbers. In case you have forgotten about multidigit subtraction by hand, please have a look at this video:\n\n\n\nInverse operations\nMany approaches to find solutions to quantitative questions rely on the idea of inverse operations. For example, if \\(x+5=7\\), in spoken language that means that \\(5\\) added to unknown quantity \\(x\\) equals \\(7\\). Hence, subtracting \\(5\\) from \\(7\\) we find that \\(x=2\\). This solution relies on the idea that addition and subtraction are inverse operations. That is, if we add five to \\(x\\) (which gave us seven), then subtracting five from that result gets us back to \\(x\\).\nThe easiest way to understand this is to revisit the number line, and inspect at a bunch of points how, adding a particular number and then subtracting that same number, affects your position on the number line, as shown in Figure 2. The conclusion here is that adding some number \\(a\\) and then subtracting \\(a\\) leads to a neat roundtrip 🔁. You’re back where you started!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Visualisation of addition and subtraction as inverse operations\n\n\n\nAnd this does not just apply to numbers, but also to variables. That is, if \\(x+y=3\\), then subtracting variable \\(y\\) from \\(x+y\\) gets us back to \\(x\\). Hence, \\(x=3-y\\).\n\n\nMultiplication\nThe easiest example to conceptualise multiplication is to think of an area. Say you live in a studio that is five metres wide and three metres deep. How to quantify the area in a meaningful manner? A simple idea is to take a square of one by one metere (i.e., a square metre denoted by \\(1 \\text{m}^2\\)), and see how often that square metre fits in the room. Using the diagram in Figure 3, which shows the studio from above, we see that, in total, \\(15\\) square metres fit into it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Area of studio that is five by three metres\n\n\n\nThat is, the area equals \\(3 \\text{m} \\times 5 \\text{m} = 15 \\text{m}^2\\). But how did that number actually arise? One way to think about this that for each of the three metres along its depth, you have five metres of width. So you get an area \\(5 \\text{m}^2\\) in the bottom row of the diagram, \\(5 \\text{m}^2\\) in the middle row, and \\(5 \\text{m}^2\\) in the top row, yielding an area of \\(5+5+5=15 \\text{m}^2\\) in total. Thus, multiplication is simply repeated addition!\nMore generally, for whole numbers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), we have that \\(a \\times b = \\underbrace{b + b + \\ldots + b}_{a \\text{ times}}\\). Moreover, \\(a \\times b = b \\times a\\). And, hence, \\(a \\times b = \\underbrace{a + a + \\ldots + a}_{b \\text{ times}}\\). Going back to the example, adding up \\(3\\) five times yields \\(15\\), and so does adding up \\(5\\) three times.\nWe often use shorter notation for multiplication, namely \\(a \\cdot b\\). And in case \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both variables (i.e. not specific numbers), we can even writen \\(ab\\). However, in case of numbers we really need a multiplication symbol. After all \\(3 \\times 2 = 3 \\cdot 2 = 6 \\neq 32\\).\nIn case of a mix of numbers and variables (e.g., \\(3 \\cdot x\\)), the convention is to leave out the multiplication symbol altogether, and to put the number in front of the variable. So \\(3x\\), but not \\(x3\\). Also, make sure to never confuse the classical multiplication symbol \\(\\times\\) with the letter \\(x\\)! Finally, when writing code or doing calculations in Excel, we do multiplication using an asterisk (i.e., *). So for example =3*5 tells Excel to multiply three and five.\nFor multiplication of any two real numbers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) (so also negative, rational and irrational numbers) you should be intimately familiar with the following facts:\n\n\\(0 \\times a = 0\\) (zero times a number is zero)\n\\(-a = (-1) \\times a\\) (a negative number is simply a positive number times negative one and vice versa)\n\\(ab = ba\\) (order of multiplication does not matter)\nif both are positive, then \\(ab\\) is positive\nif both are negative, then \\(ab\\) is positive\nif one is positive and the other negative, then \\(ab\\) is negative\n\nCheck if you agree with all these facts! We can again use a number line to understand some of the basic facts of multiplication:\n\n\nDivision\n\n\nInverse operations revisited\ntba\n\n\nPowers and exponents\n\n\nLogarithms\n\n\nInverse operations revisited… again!\ntba\n\n\nParentheses and order of operations"
