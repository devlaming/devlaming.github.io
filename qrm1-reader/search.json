If you have spotted an error, please send an e-mail to r.devlaming@vu.nl.\n\nCourse at a glance\nThe bachelor Economics and Business Economics (EBE) comprises three core academic courses, namely, Quantitative Research Methods (QRM) 1, QRM2, and QRM3, which are taught in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd year respectively. In these courses, you develop mathematical and statistical skills that you need to answer questions in economics and business in a meaningfull, quantitative manner.\nWhile QRM2 and QRM3 pay much attention to statistics, econometrics, and their applications, QRM1 is a more fundamental course, in which you learn about core concepts from mathematics, linear algebra, and calculus. Thus, QRM2 and QRM3, as well as many other courses in the EBE bachelor, build on the knowledge you acquire in this course.\n\n\n\n\nCopyrightRonald de Vlaming. 2024. All Rights Reserved"

    "text": "This week, we start with a careful treatment of mathematical concepts you have learnt about in high school. Specifically, we begin the by discussing numbers. What are integers, real numbers, and so on? And what are variables in mathematics, and why are they useful? With those concepts in place, we can talk about algebra: expressions involving numbers, variables, and operators, such as addition and multiplication, and exponentiation. How to evaluate and simplify such expression?\nNext, we can look at equalities and inequalities: if two expressions are equal, then what can we learn about the underlying variables? Specifically, we consider solving linear and quadratic equations. And what if one expression is know to be larger than the other? What can we learn, in that case, about certain variables?\nAfter that, we turn our attention to functions: why are they useful? what is the right notation? And what are things like the domain and image of a function? With those concepts in place, we can look at finding roots of a function, which actually boils down to simply solving equations.\nFinally, we go a little bit into set theory and indices, and use that to formulate so-called aggregation operators, such as the summation and product operator."

After all, you cannot have a negative number of apples. Thus, equations (more on that later) with negative solutions (e.g., \\(4x + 20 = 4 \\Leftrightarrow x=-4\\)) were considered to be absurb by Greek mathematicians. Even as late as the 16th century, negative numbers were, in academic work, sometimes still referred to as absurd numbers.\nHowever, even for simple accounting purposes, such as a decrease in your stock of apples, a debt to a counterparty, and so on, the uses of negative numbers became ever more apparant. Nowadays, negative numbers are recognised as an integral part of everyday calculations.\nThere are seven important things to remember about negative numbers:\n\nWe denote negative numbers by placing the minus sign (\\(-\\)) in front of the number. So \\(-4\\) denotes negative four. Positive numbers, on the other hand, are either denoted by placing the plus sign (\\(+\\)) in front of it or by not writing down the sign altogether (more common). So both \\(4\\) and \\(+4\\) denote positive four, where \\(4\\) is the more common notation.\nAdding up negative \\(x\\) and positive \\(x\\), where \\(x\\) is a number, yields zero: they are opposite numbers that cancel when added up. So \\(-x+x=0\\).\nThe more negative a number is, the smaller it is. So, for example, \\(-5 &lt; -4\\), while on the positive side, \\(5 &gt; 4\\).\nThe negative of a negative number is a positive number. That is, \\(-(-x)=x\\).\nA negative number \\(-x\\) times another negative number \\(-y\\) yields a positive number, which is equal to multiplying \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). So \\(-4\\) times \\(-3\\) yields the same result as \\(4\\) times \\(3\\), which is \\(12\\).\nA negative number \\(-x\\) times a positive number \\(y\\) yields a negative result, which is equal to the negative of multiplying \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). So \\(-4\\) times \\(3\\) equals the negative of \\(4\\) times \\(3\\), so \\(-12\\).\nA negative number \\(-x\\) can also be thought of as \\(x\\) multiplied by \\(-1\\). So simply using (i) all positive numbers, (ii) multiplication, and (iii) only a single negative number, namely \\(-1\\), we have a way to describe all negative numbers that exist.\n\n\n\nInfinity\nThe introduction of negative numbers is what we call an abstraction: we started with something clearly rooted in our understanding of reality at the time (i.e., counts), and we made the concept a bit more general (i.e., negative numbers), to help us solve more problems, that are still relevant in everyday life (e.g., keeping track of someone’s debt).\nTwo further abstractions that arose as mathematics matured were the number zero (which effectively says there is nothing to count) and the number infinity, denoted by \\(\\infty\\). Clearly, in our everyday lives infinity does not exist: we live in finite world, with finite resources, finite energy, and so on.\nYet, zero and infinity are extremely useful to calculate certain things: they are an crucial part of calculus (i.e., differentiation and integration), which is all about finding optimal points (e.g., how much crop to grow to maximise profit?), areas and volumes (e.g., what is the volume of a ball with radius \\(r\\)?), as well as certain expectations (e.g., what is my expected profit, under all kinds of circumstances, that happen with different probabilities?).\nJust like any number \\(x\\) has a negative counterpart \\(-x\\), so does \\(\\infty\\) have negative counterpart \\(-\\infty\\).\nThe complete set of all whole numbers, so both negative and positive, ranging from \\(-\\infty\\) to \\(\\infty\\), are called the integers. This set of numbers is sometimes denoted by \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\). That is, \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\) consists of \\(\\ldots,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,\\ldots\\), where the dots signify that numbers just keep on going on, all the way down to \\(-\\infty\\) on the left and all the way up to \\(\\infty\\) on the right."

If you have a single apple to share equally with a friend, you both have half an apple. That is, you both have \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\), where the upper term (here \\(1\\)) is called the numerator (Dutch: teller) and the lower term (here \\(2\\)) the denominator (Dutch: noemer).\nMore generally, rational numbers are written in the form \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\) where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both integers (so including negative numbers). When considering counts (so \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) both being natural numbers), \\(a\\) tells us how many units of one thing we have (e.g., the number of apples \\(a\\)) and \\(b\\) tells us across how many other units to divide this (e.g., the number of people \\(b\\) who get to share those \\(a\\) apples).\nThe complete set of all rational numbers, so \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\), for any integer \\(a\\) and any integer \\(b\\), is denoted by \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\)."

However, this turns out to be wrong: \\(\\pi\\) cannot be expressed as the ratio of two whole numbers. And it does not stop there—there exist infinitely many numbers that cannot be expressed as the ratio of two integers. Such numbers are said to be irrational.\nFor example, take a square with sides of length one, and calculate the length of a line that you draw from one corner of the square to the corner on the opposite side (i.e., you split the square into two identical triangles):\n\n\n\nHypotenuse with irrational length\n\n\nThat length, by Pythagoras’ Theorem, equals \\(\\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2}=\\sqrt{2}\\). That number also cannot be described as the ratio of two whole numbers. Nevertheless, Ancient Greek society considered the whole idea of irrational numbers to be blasphemy. They refused to accept evidence that \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) was irrational, and even forbade considering such numbers:\n\nHowever, proof for the existence of irrational numbers is undeniable: they arise naturally in geometry, for instance, when considering the circumference of a circle or the hypotenuse (Dutch: schuine zijde) of right triangle (Dutch: rechthoekige driehoek). And they also arise in calculus, for instance, when we consider a number \\(e\\), such that the rate of change of \\(e^x\\) with respect to \\(x\\), also equals \\(e^x\\) (Euler’s number).\nCombining the irrational and rational numbers into a grand set of numbers, we arrive at the set of so-called real numbers, which is denoted by \\(\\mathbb{R}\\). This set contains any number on the number line from \\(-\\infty\\) to \\(\\infty\\), regardless of whether irrational or rational. The whole numbers are in fact the working horse of much of modern mathematics, including calculus."
